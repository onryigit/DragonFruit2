What I want to show

- Current behavior
  - Simple DragonFruit (    Console.WriteLine($"Hello, { result.Args?.Name}, you're {result.Args.Age} years old");)
  - Validation (Sample...MyArgs.Age and MyArgs.Name for required)
  - Default values (SubcommandArgs.Greeting)
  - Subcommands
  
- Philosophies
  - Let System.CommandLine do what it does best - parse and strongly type
  - Allow flexibility in everything else
  - In all things, support the most C#-y way to do things
  - Be as simple as self-parsing for anything more complex than a single argument
  - Be far simpler for anything moderately complex
  - Not die under very complex scenarios (like `dotnet CLI`)

What I need

- Feedback
  - General - Am I crazy?
  - Does this hit the right simplicity marks?
  - When should I make this public?
  - Anything/everything else ;)
  - ISSUES!!!! (I'm looking at you Chet ;)

- Deeper involvement
  - Design partner(s)?
  - System.CommandLine expert (occasional)
  - Roslyn generation review
  - Polyfills (eek! help!)
  - NuGet help
  - Eventually maintainers (possibly outside this group) and they will need to define repo
  - I won't turn down coding help
